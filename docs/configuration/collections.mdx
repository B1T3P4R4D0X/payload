A Collection is a group of records, called Documents, that all share a common schema. You can define as many Collections as your application needs. Each Document in a Collection is stored in the [Database](../database/overview) based on the [Fields](../fields/overview) that you define, and automatically generates a [Local API](../local-api/overview), [REST API](../rest-api/overview), and [GraphQL API](../graphql/overview) used to manage your Documents.

Collections are also used to achieve [Authentication](../authentication/overview) in Payload. By defining a Collection with `auth` options, that Collection receives additional operations to support user authentication.

Collections are the primary way to structure recurring data in your application, such as users, products, pages, posts, and other types of content that you might want to manage. Each Collection can have its own unique [Access Control](../access-control/overview), [Hooks](../hooks/overview), [Admin Options](#admin-options), and more.

To define a Collection Config, use the `collection` property in your [Payload Config](./overview):

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  collections: [ // highlight-line
    // Your Collections go here
  ],
})
```

  **Tip:**
  If your Collection is only ever meant to contain a single Document, consider using a [Global](./globals) instead.

## Config Options

It's often best practice to write your Collections in separate files and then import them into the main [Payload Config](./overview).

Here is what a simple Collection Config might look like:

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'posts',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'title',
      type: 'text',
    }
  ]
}
```

### Fields

Fields define the schema of the Documents within a Collection. To learn more, go to the [Fields](../fields/overview) documentation.

### Access Control

[Collection Access Control](../access-control/overview) determines what a user can and cannot do with any given Document within a Collection. To learn more, go to the [Access Control](../access-control/overview) documentation.

### Hooks

[Collection Hooks](../hooks/collections) allow you to tie into the lifecycle of your Documents so you can execute your own logic during specific events. To learn more, go to the [Hooks](../hooks/overview) documentation.

## Admin Options

The behavior of Collections within the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview) can be fully customized to fit the needs of your application. This includes grouping or hiding their navigation links, adding [Custom Components](../custom-components/overview), selecting which fields to display in the List View, and more.

To configure Admin Options for Collections, use the `admin` property in your Collection Config:

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const MyCollection: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: { // highlight-line
    // ...
  },
}
```

The following options are available:

| Option                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `group`                      | Text or localization object used to group Collection and Global links in the admin navigation. Set to `false` to hide the link from the navigation while keeping its routes accessible.                                      |
| `hidden`                     | Set to true or a function, called with the current user, returning true to exclude this Collection from navigation and admin routing.                                                                                        |
| `hooks`                      | Admin-specific hooks for this Collection. [More details](../hooks/collections).                                                                                                                                              |
| `useAsTitle`                 | Specify a top-level field to use for a document title throughout the Admin Panel. If no field is defined, the ID of the document is used as the title. A field with `virtual: true` cannot be used as the title.             |
| `description`                | Text to display below the Collection label in the List View to give editors more information. Alternatively, you can use the `admin.components.Description` to render a React component. [More details](../custom-components#list-view). |
| `defaultColumns`             | Array of field names that correspond to which columns to show by default in this Collection's List View.                                                                                                                     |
| `hideAPIURL`                 | Hides the "API URL" meta field while editing documents within this Collection.                                                                                                                                               |
| `enableRichTextLink`         | The [Rich Text](../fields/rich-text) field features a `Link` element which allows for users to automatically reference related documents within their rich text. Set to `true` by default.                                   |
| `enableRichTextRelationship` | The [Rich Text](../fields/rich-text) field features a `Relationship` element which allows for users to automatically reference related documents within their rich text. Set to `true` by default.                           |
| `meta`                       | Page metadata overrides to apply to this Collection within the Admin Panel. [More details](../admin/metadata).                                                                                                                      |
| `preview`                    | Function to generate preview URLs within the Admin Panel that can point to your app. [More details](../admin/preview).                                                                                                               |
| `livePreview`                | Enable real-time editing for instant visual feedback of your front-end application. [More details](../live-preview/overview).                                                                                                |
| `components`                 | Swap in your own React components to be used within this Collection. [More details](../custom-components/overview).                                                                                                                     |
| `listSearchableFields`       | Specify which fields should be searched in the List search view. [More details](../admin/list-view#list-searchable-fields).                                                                                                                    |
| `pagination`                 | Set pagination-specific options for this Collection. [More details](../admin/list-view#pagination).                                                                                                                                            |
| `baseListFilter`             | You can define a default base filter for this collection's List view, which will be merged into any filters that the user performs. [More details](../admin/list-view#base-list-filter).                                                                                          |

## GraphQL

You can completely disable GraphQL for this collection by passing `graphQL: false` to your collection config. This will completely disable all queries, mutations, and types from appearing in your GraphQL schema.

You can also pass an object to the collection's `graphQL` property, which allows you to define the following properties:

| Option                 | Description                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `singularName`     | Override the "singular" name that will be used in GraphQL schema generation.        |
| `pluralName`       | Override the "plural" name that will be used in GraphQL schema generation.          |
| `disableQueries`   | Disable all GraphQL queries that correspond to this collection by passing `true`.   |
| `disableMutations` | Disable all GraphQL mutations that correspond to this collection by passing `true`. |

## TypeScript

You can import types from Payload to help make writing your Collection configs easier and type-safe. There are two main types that represent the Collection Config, `CollectionConfig` and `SanitizeCollectionConfig`.

The `CollectionConfig` type represents a raw Collection Config in its full form, where only the bare minimum properties are marked as required. The `SanitizedCollectionConfig` type represents a Collection Config after it has been fully sanitized. Generally, this is only used internally by Payload.

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig, SanitizedCollectionConfig } from 'payload'
```
